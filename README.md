# Privacy Policy Template


This Privacy Policy Template is covers the general privacy concerns and regulations. I hope you find it useful and a good starting point in compiling your own privacy policy for use on your own website or app. Feel free to add stuff that I haven't added, and remove stuff that you don't like. If there are ways that I can do things better, you should absolutely report issues or send me a pull request because I love them so much.


## What is a Privacy Policy

A privacy policy is a description of what you do with personal data.  The critical things to describe in the policy are how you and your website or app collect, use, store, and share or disclose information about people. Providing a privacy policy also helps your users understand what happens to information about them.

**Note:** A Privacy Policy is not the same as the Terms and Conditions agreement. A Terms and Conditions is the agreement where you include the rules and guidelines that users must agree to in order to use your website or app.


## What is a Personal Data

Personal data is any kind of data or information that can be considered personal (identifies an individual):

* First and last name
* Email address
* Billing and shipping address
* Credit card information
* And so on


## When is a Privacy Policy required

The Privacy Policy is required by law if you collect personal data. One should be provided where your website or app does anything with personal data. A Privacy Policy is required regardless of the type of platform your business operates on or what kind of industry you’re in:
